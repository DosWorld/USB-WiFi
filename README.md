Note: While this site is maintained by Linux users for Linux users, Windows users are welcome also. No, we don't intend to add support for
USB WiFi adapter use on Windows but the list of adapters shown in menu item 2 contains information and links to a lot of good quality
adapters that also work well in Windows...this will prove beneficial to you Windows users when you try Linux...and we know you will.

Any information and links you can provide are welcome. Submit the information and links by clicking on Issues.
