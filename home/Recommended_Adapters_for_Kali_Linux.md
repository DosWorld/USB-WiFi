## Recommended Adapters for Kali Linux

Kali and other distros used for pen testing, security analysis and other
monitor mode work need usb wifi adapters that have adapters with drivers
that do an excellent job of supporting monitor mode. The list of
recommended adapters below are in order with the best rated at the top.

Note: The adapter that meets your needs can depend on exactly what you
plan to do so asking question is a good idea.

Note: All listed adapters are single-state (no Windows driver onboard) and single-function (wifi only).
